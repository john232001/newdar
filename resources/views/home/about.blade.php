          <h2>Agrarian Reform History</h2>
          <p>
              The history of agrarian reform in the Philippines dates back to the early 20th century,
               when the American colonial government implemented a number of measures aimed at improving the lives of Filipino farmers. These measures included the Homestead Act of 1903, which allowed individuals to claim land for free if they cultivated it for five years,
               and the Cadastral Act of 1913, which established a system for surveying and registering land ownership.
